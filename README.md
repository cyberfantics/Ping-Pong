# Ping Pong Game

This is a simple Ping Pong game developed using Python's turtle module. The game features two paddles and a ball, with players controlling the paddles to hit the ball back and forth. The score is kept for each miss.

## How to Play

- **Player 1 (Left Paddle):** Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move the paddle up and down.
- **Player 2 (Right Paddle):** Use the `8` and `2` keys on the keyboard to move the paddle up and down.

The ball will bounce off the top and bottom edges of the screen. If a player misses the ball, the other player scores a point.
